# Joshua DesMarais's Portfolio

My name is Josh DesMarais, I am an environmental scientist taking this class through Open University. I hope to go to grad school in fall of 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, part 1
This was my favorite lab because it was a calculation I was already somewhat familiar with, and one that I’ve used in the past. In this lab we calculated Basal Metabolic Rate based on gender, age, height, and weight. We learned how to take user input, and use it to perform basic calculations and print the results. It was a simple program, but it was good for developing fundamental skills necessary for future labs.

Lab 6, part 2
This was my second favorite lab. It was more challenging than most labs, so completing it was very satisfying. It was also fairly easy to understand the objective, since all we had to do was play a simplified game of blackjack. In this lab, we learned to use functions from multiple files, and then took inputs from the command line to run the program. This proved to be tricky to implement, but was very helpful for future labs.

Lab 8, part 2
This was my third favorite lab. It was fun and simple, and was a good example of using coding creatively. In this lab, we used for loops to create a simple pattern. It was one of the first times we used for loops, and the simplicity of the end result made it easy to understand what was going wrong. I felt that this was a good assignment to demonstrate the use of for loops.
